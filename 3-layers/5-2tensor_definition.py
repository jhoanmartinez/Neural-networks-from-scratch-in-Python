#A tensor object is an object that can be represented as an array.

# What this means is, as programmers, we can (and will) treat tensors as arrays in the context of
# deep learning, and that’s really all the thought we have to put into it. Are all tensors just arrays?
# No, but they are represented as arrays in our code, so, to us, they’re only arrays, and this is why
# there’s so much argument and confusion.
